My notes helped me during the exam, gave me ideas when I was stuck and saved me a lot of time searching for how to implement commands.

There are tools and instructions on how to use them and TODO lists. In order to ensure that I didn't miss any steps during the enumeration process, I made these lists. Making them before the exam was the best thing I did. Stress and excitement during the exam caused me to forget things, and this list saved me.

Furthermore, I will share with you the boxes I did from PG and HTB that helped me pass the exam
