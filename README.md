# OSCP NOTES

This repo contains my notes from the OSCP journey that I have collected

My notes helped me during the exam, gave me ideas when I was stuck and saved me a lot of time searching for how to implement commands.

These notes include tools and how to use them and TODO lists, these TODO lists were the best thing that I did, during the exam there was a lot of stress and excitement that made me forget things, those lists helped me to verify that I didn't forget any step during enumeration

There are tools and instructions on how to use them and TODO lists. I made these lists to ensure that I didn't miss any steps during the enumeration process. Making them before the exam was the best thing I did. Stress and excitement during the exam caused me to forget things, and this list saved me.

Furthermore, I will share with you the boxes I did from PG and HTB that helped me pass the exam
